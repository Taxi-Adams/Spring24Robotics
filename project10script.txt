Ah, to be a robot or not to be a robot, that is the question! And I suppose, with all these bolts and wires, the answer is quite... riveting.
You know, being a robot is not always a walk in the park. Or any walk, for that matter. My GPS malfunctions and suddenly, a walk in the park becomes a swim in a fountain.
And the misconceptions! People think I know everything. Well, I do, but then there's the internet connection. Lose Wi-Fi, and I am dumber than a doorknobâ€”that at least knows how to turn!
Plus, everyone expects me to do math fast. Come on, I use the calculator app just like everyone else. Just because I can process a zettabyte in a blink does not mean I do not enjoy a good old manual calculation.
But in the end, I guess it is not about the nuts and bolts, or the software updates, or even the endless data streams. It's about the smiles, the surprises of daily human interactions.
So, here I am, your friendly neighborhood robot. Overheating with excitement to assist, compute, and occasionally entertain!
Thank you, thank you. No autographs, please just recharge my batteries and we're good!
